<p>PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that‚Äôs known for its flexibility and ease of use.
This is enabled in part by its compatibility with the popular Python high-level programming language favored
by machine learning developers and data scientists.</p>
<p>PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning that‚Äôs
commonly used in applications like image recognitionÔ∏è and language processing. Written in Python, it‚Äôs relatively
easy for most machine learning developers to learn and use. PyTorch is distinctive for its excellent support for GPUs
and its use of reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which enables computation graphs to be modified on the fly. This makes it a
popular choice for fast experimentation and prototyping.</p>
<p>PyTorch is the work of developers at Facebook AI Research and several other labs. The framework combines the efficient and
flexible GPU-accelerated back-end libraries from Torch with an intuitive Python frontend that focuses on rapid prototyping,
readable code, and support for the widest possible variety of deep learning models. PyTorch lets developers use the familiar
imperative programming approach but still output to graphs. It was released to open source in 2017, and its Python roots have
made it a favorite with machine learning developers.</p>
